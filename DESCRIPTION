Description: SFAmix is a bayesian statistical method that decomposes a normally distributed matrix into the product of a sparse loading matrix, and a dense factor matrix. The method employs a three parameter beta distribution that act as a spike and slab prior to induce sparsity to the loading matrix. The method further consider the loading to be drawn from a mixture of sparse and dense component, which allows it to model the hidden confounding (in its dense component). The method is especially suitable for deriving context informed functional gene modules, where the context can be inferred from the factor matrix, and the sparse gene modules can be found on the corresponding loadings.
