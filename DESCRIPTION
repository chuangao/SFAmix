Description: SFAmix is a bayesian statistical method that decomposes a normally distributed matrix into the product of a sparse loading matrix, and a dense factor matrix. The method induce shrinkage to the loading matrix via a three parameter beta distribution as its prior. It further consider the loadings to be drawn from a mixture of sparse and dense component, which allows modeling of the hidden confounding. The method is especially suitable for deriving context informed functional gene modules, where the context is inferred from the factor matrix, and the sparse gene modules are found on the corresponding loadings.
